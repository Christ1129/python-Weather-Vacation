This repository contains the VacationPy and WeatherPy folders. Each folder includes the main Jupyter Notebook files used to perform the anlysis. Each folder also includes the resulting images from the analysis of each dataset. The weatherPy folder contains the output csv file.

The main Jupyter Notebook files for each dataset contains the analysis conclusions within the file in markdown cells.

### Observations and Insights

After analyzing the graphs, several considerations can be made, including the following:

The Northern Hemisphere displays a negative slope with a negative correlation between Temperature and Latitude, however the Southern Hemisphere displays a positive slope with a positive correlation between Temperature and Latitude. In other words, as you move away from the equator in the Northern Hemisphere the temperature decreases. Conversely, as you move away from the equator in the Southern Hemisphere the temperature increases
The graphs show that there are no clear relationship beetween Humidity and Latitude in the northern and Southern Hemisphere. We can however observe a weak positive correlation between latitude and humidity
There are no clear relationship between Latitude and Wind Speed in the graphs. We can observe a weak positive correlation between latitude and Wind Speed for northern hemisphere and weak negative correlation between latitude and Wind Speed for Southern hemisphere.
